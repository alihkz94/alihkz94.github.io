Bioinformatician              11/2020 - 09/2021   
Imam Khomeini Hospital  – Tehran , Iran  
• Executed 10X Chromium scRNA -seq and prepared CROP -seq libraries from gastric cancer organoids for in  
vivo CRISPR screens.  

• Applied UMI sequencing to identify enriched sgRNAs and integrate multiome data (>100k cells/donor) with  
spatial transcriptomic.  
• Performed gene -set enrichment, somatic CNV, clonal evolution, and tissue -specific driver analyses using  
Seurat, Scanpy, MAST, scCN, and MOFA.  
• Developed machine learning models with scVI, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for spatial mapping, cell type  
classification, and clone fitness prediction  
• Conducted WGS and WES data analysis (JWES and Nvidia Parabricks) to identify somatic and germline  
mutations, structural variants, and potential therapeutic targets  
Labrotary Assistant ,            09/2013 - 09/2015   
Tabriz University  – Tabriz , Iran  
• Cared for and maintained colonies of rats and mice, ensuring their well -being and adherence to ethical 
guidelines.  
• Conducted behavioral assays, including the Morris water maze to evaluate spatial memory and the T -maze to 
assess decision -making processes.  
• Analyzed data using Rtrack for water maze experiments and MouBeAT for T -maze studies.  
• Administered substances via oral, intraperitoneal (IP), and intramuscular (IM) injections.  
• Harvested brain and liver tissues for subsequent biochemical analyses.  
• Performed spectrophotometric assays to assess toxicity and stress markers in collected tissues.
